#justifications
the following are justifications I used for various parts of assessment 1 and 2

- Assessment 1
  -- I made the image 100% width for the hotel even knowing it will stretch at higher tablet settings
  primarily because there would be an image answer for this in a real world scenario.
  -- with flat images, can only guess at fonts so left it default, with font-sizes tried to make best guess based
  on what I could measure

- Assessment 2
  -- uses localstorge for the submit save and reload. I don't have a database for this and no api so that was the best solution I could
  come up with for page refreshes.
